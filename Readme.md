XAML Kitchen Sink
=================

This is a github repository I started as a dumping ground for all the usefull chunks of code for XAML, view models, etc. This is mostly focused on WPF, but could be applicable to Silverlight, Windows Store Apps, Windows Phone 7/8 apps, etc.

Other Projects
--------------
[WPF Crutches](https://bitbucket.org/rstarkov/wpfcrutches) was started many years ago, but has some fantastic tools.

One I've used the most is the `ObservableSortedList<T>` which you can read about [here](http://roman.st/Article/Sorting-ObservableCollection-ObservableSortedList).
